# How can i update my mods?
To update the mods of a minecraft instance, there is a file named "Update_Mods.bat". And a file named, Mod_folder_path.txt. By default is the mod folder in ...\appdata\roaming\.minecraft\mods, but you must update this path to the path of the mods folder of your instence, and run "Update_Mods.bat". (remember, this bat only funtion if you donwloaded this repository via Git)
